# POC For Rendering Graph Component In Swagger UI

This project demonstrates a full-stack setup where FastAPI serves an OpenAPI (Swagger) backend, and React consumes the OpenAPI schema to display a Swagger UI, including custom visualizations like graph views with React Flow.

## Project Structure

This project consists of two main directories:

- **my-swagger-fastapi** (Backend - FastAPI)
- **my-swagger-react** (Frontend - React)

### Directory Structure:

```plaintext
my-swagger-project/
│
├── my-swagger-fastapi/      # FastAPI backend with OpenAPI support
│   ├── main.py              # FastAPI main file
│   ├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
│   └── ...
│
└── my-swagger-react/        # React frontend with Swagger UI and custom graph plugin
    ├── src/                 # React components
    ├── package.json         # JavaScript dependencies
    └── ...
```
## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+** (for FastAPI)
- **Node.js** (for React)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing frontend dependencies)

---

## Setting up the FastAPI Backend (my-swagger-fastapi)

1. **Navigate to the `my-swagger-fastapi` directory**:

    ```bash
    cd my-swagger-fastapi
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the FastAPI server**:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The FastAPI server will start running at `http://localhost:8000`.

    - Swagger UI (backend) is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
    - OpenAPI schema is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`.

---

## Setting up the React Frontend (my-swagger-react)

1. **Navigate to the `my-swagger-react` directory**:

    ```bash
    cd ../my-swagger-react
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the React development server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The React app will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

    The React frontend fetches the OpenAPI schema from FastAPI and displays it using Swagger UI. You can view API documentation and custom graph visualizations.

---

## Running the Projects

To run both the FastAPI backend and the React frontend together, follow these steps:

1. **Start the FastAPI Backend**:

    - Open a terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd my-swagger-fastapi
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    This will start the FastAPI server at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Start the React Frontend**:

    - Open another terminal, navigate to the `my-swagger-react` directory, and run:

    ```bash
    cd my-swagger-react
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Access the Application**:

    - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
    - The React app will display the Swagger UI, including the custom graph visualizations based on the API responses from FastAPI.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that the FastAPI backend (`http://localhost:8000`) is running before trying to access the React frontend.
- The custom graph view is available for certain response types (such as `graph`), which can be visualized using React Flow in the Swagger UI.
- If you modify the FastAPI backend or the React frontend, you may need to restart the respective servers for the changes to take effect.
